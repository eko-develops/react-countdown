## Description
This project was created to practice using React hooks, ``useState`` and ``useEffect``. The app is made with React and some Material UI components. The project also includes how to use ``setInterval`` in a React application. The app also makes use of a ``clean up`` function that works in hand with ``useEffect``. The buttons and text when the timer is finished are done with conditional rendering.
